/**
 * Selects matching resources for a URI based on registered templates.
 *
 * Template matching rules are a [dramatic] simplification of JAX-RS.
 * Matching is done component-wise on the path (i.e., on each component
 * delimited by '/' characters, and the longest resource in terms of
 * _path components_ (not literal characters as in JAX-RS) wins, with
 * ties broken by number of template parameters matched. Behavior is
 * best conveyed by example:
 *
 * Consider two resources, `/orgs/{org}/user/{id}` and
 * `/orgs/all/user/{id}`. For the following requests
 *
 *     GET /orgs/foo.com/user/7
 *
 * and
 *
 *     GET /orgs/all/user/11
 *
 * the former wins, as it matches two template variables.
